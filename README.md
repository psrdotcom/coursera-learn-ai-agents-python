# Learnings from Coursera Course: AI Agents and Agentic AI with Python & Generative AI

This repository contains notes, code, and experiments from the Coursera course [AI Agents and Agentic AI with Python & Generative AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-agents-python/home/welcome).

## Key Learnings

- **Understanding AI Agents**: Explored the concept of agents in AI, including their architecture, environment interaction, and decision-making processes.
- **Agentic AI**: Learned how agentic systems differ from traditional AI, focusing on autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and adaptability.
- **Python for AI Agents**: Implemented agentic patterns and algorithms using Python, including state management, environment simulation, and agent communication.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Integrated generative AI models (such as LLMs) with agentic workflows to enable reasoning, planning, and creative problem-solving.
- **Practical Applications**: Built and experimented with agentic systems for tasks like automation, data analysis, and conversational AI.
- **Best Practices**: Covered ethical considerations, prompt engineering, and evaluation metrics for agentic and generative AI systems.

## Repository Structure
- Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on exercises and experiments
- Python scripts for agent implementations
- Documentation and notes summarizing each module
